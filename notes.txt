- I want to make a user login option option. If a some registers as a user with a password
  they will get access to another page in the website which prompts them for some astrology info
  and then after they imputed it, they can get daily astology readings there

- thinking of using firebase for storage. I want to build an api in java to fetch userdata,
  product data, and fetch and compute astrology data. This will mean I'll have to pay for hosting.

- I also want to include that outro from dorohdoro, the one with the glowing mushrooms somwhere in the
  app (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY3MyHAFc68&ab_channel=TOHOanimation%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB)
